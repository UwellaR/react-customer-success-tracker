Ogugu Customer Service App 

Ogugu is an Android mobile application that provides a business analytics platform with a subscription service. For this project, I created a customer feedback page with a form where customers can submit queries concerning problems with the app. A representative from the Ogugu team would then work to fix the problems and mark the query as completed or ongoing.
